## 📖 What I Learned

### 🔹 Inheritance
Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class using the `extends` keyword. It helps in code reusability and establishes an **IS-A** relationship.

**Syntax:**

```java
class Parent {
    // properties and methods
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // additional properties and methods
}
```

---

### 🔹 Types of Inheritance

#### 1. Single Inheritance
One child class inherits from one parent class.

```
Parent
   ↑
 Child
```

---

#### 2. Multilevel Inheritance
A class inherits from another child class.

```
Student
   ↑
Mentor
   ↑
HOD
```

---

#### 3. Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.

```
      Student
      /     \
 Mentor     HOD
```

---

#### 4. Multiple Inheritance
Java does **not** support multiple inheritance using classes because it can lead to ambiguity (Diamond Problem).

It is achieved using **Interfaces**.

```
Interface A
      \
       \
     Interface B
         |
       Class C
```

---

### 🔹 Method Overriding

Method Overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that already exists in the parent class.

**Example:**

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of hiding data by making variables `private` and accessing them using public methods (getters and setters).

**Example:**

```java
class Student {
    private int studentId;

    public void setStudentId(int studentId) {
        this.studentId = studentId;
    }

    public int getStudentId() {
        return studentId;
    }
}
```

## 🚀 Outcome

Today, I strengthened my understanding of Java Object-Oriented Programming by implementing inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation through practical examples. These concepts form the foundation for building reusable, maintainable, and scalable Java applications.
